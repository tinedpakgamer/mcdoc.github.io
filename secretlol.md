title: How Minecraft for Windows is Cracked/Patched

::: warning Note
This page is focused for Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. However it can be used for other apps that meet required conditions.

<!-- ## Methods

There are different ways to crack Minecraft and they are said [**in the Glossary here**](/windows/minecraft-for-windows#minecraft-for-windows). These methods are specifically done by softwares/programs. Lets now define all these methods and what they mean.

As in the glossary, you can see that:
- **DLL Replacing** method replaces your own DLLs with cracked DLLs. This is completely permanent and might not be the correct solution if you want to go with "safer"
- **DRC** method makes your game use cracked dll available in another directory in your computer using the [DLL search order](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order). [Temporary, Works only with Minecraft]
- **DLL Auto Patch** method creates patched DLLs from your own dlls and replaces the original ones with patched ones. This is much effecient than DLL Replacing with Online Sources since sometimes online source might not have the specific one needed. We'll look into this later.
- **DLL Hooking** method uses [**function hooking**](https://kylehalladay.com/blog/2020/11/13/Hooking-By-Example.html) and other debugging stuff to modify the license checking functions within the game and/or other DLLs loaded within the game in memory. [Temporary, Works only with Minecraft]
- **DMM** method patches the DLLs within the game memory. [Temporary, Works only with Minecraft] 

As you have read, DRC, DMM and DLL Hooking runs and change in-memory/RAM. This means, the changes are done in the game's process leading it to be temporary (requiring for activating every time) and only work for Minecraft. But these methods are different from I-MCM and pre-cracked [**appx**](https://fileinfo.com/extension/appx).The way these 2 works is patching the license checking code with in the game. (in meaning, it removes the code where Minecraft checks for license). **I-MCM** patches the license checking code within the game's memory, making it temporary. The main differnce between I-MCM and DMM is that I-MCM can run while Minecraft is open but cant with DMM.\
Also, you can patch the game's code completely and pack it in a `.appx` and you can install it and then you dont need to do anything else. 

There is an other method using ClipSVC, we will define that later. -->

# How Minecraft for Windows is Cracked/Patched

Minecraft for Windows uses `C:\Windows\System32\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` for its licensing system. It makes use of this DLL to perform in-app purchases and licensing related tasks like identifying if user bought game or has acquired trial.\
We crack `C:\Windows\System32\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` to modify return value of trial function and Minecraft starts working in full game mode. The crack can be done manually or by specific [Third Party Software](/windows/minecraft-for-windows#unlockers-for-minecraft-for-windows).



## How Minecraft works



To understand deeply about the DLL that gets replaced with the original dll, you will have to know about the licensing process. The licensing process is different depending on the Minecraft version you have:

### Newer Versions
Newer Versions of Minecraft uses the boolean property [Windows.Services.Store.StoreAppLicense.isTrial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.services.store.storeapplicense.istrial) from `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` to check if the user is licensed to use all features of Minecraft or just trial only features. The return value of this functions depends on whether you bought minecraft or not. Its value is affected if you have multiple accounts in PC or you have attached 10 PCs per account. In case of any issue with licensing limits, it returns true, this means Minecraft will run in trial mode

### Initial Versions
Initial Versions of Minecraft uses the boolean property [Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.LicenseInformation.isTrial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.store.licenseinformation.istrial) from `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` to check if the user is licensed to use all features of Minecraft or just trial only features. Like Windows.Services.Store.StoreAppLicense.isTrial, its value is also affected by factors like accounts and PCs and if user exceeds any limit then Minecraft runs in trial mode.

## Cracking/Patching
We crack Minecraft by modifying return value of IsTrial boolean property. This is done by editing the related function at assembly level to make it replace isTrial value with false whenever Minecraft tries to access the property
### Required Tools & Knowledge
- You might need to know about [Assembly](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/) before reading this, or your brain might explode.
- Disassembler [Interactive Dissassebler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler).

<!-- ## Extra Methods

### ClipSVC

**Tinedpakgamer** (founder of M Centers) discovered the first method to crack Minecraft using ClipSVC. But it turned out to be dangerous for your computer. It was used in MCenters 1.0 (aka Red MCenters), BlueSky Launcher etc. But what is ClipSVC? 

**`ClipSVC`**, or the Client License Service is a Windows service related to Microsoft Store. It takes care of managing and protecting digital content from the Microsoft Store, like apps and games, to make sure they follow licensing rules and digital rights management (DRM). ClipSVC is used in the process of checking the license, so disabling it will basically break every single licensing systems and no process related to it can be run. In meaning, you could force stop ClipSVC and get apps for free. But since it breaks Minecraft completely too, you will need to other steps.\
**Runtime Broker** makes sure Minecraft follows its licensing rules and security settings. Sine this is there, you will have to End Task it at the correct time, which is when Minecraft buffers loading at 46%. And as I have said, this breaks Minecraft and MS Store, and it even could lead to system errors and crashes

**And that's all! You have learnt how it works, and later on, I might plan to add new things to this page!**   -->
